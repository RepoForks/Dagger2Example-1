# Dagger2Example
A naive and simple application to illustrate how Dagger2 works and reduce difficulty in getting started with it.<br>
The app pulls The International Space Station's location from [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/) and shows it on the screen.
